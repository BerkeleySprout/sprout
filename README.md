# Sprout

Sprout is a web app aimed at promoting the knowledge and practice of wellness-oriented behaviors among the UC Berkeley student body and staff. 

The project is a "workout" platform for happiness, where users can plant a tree that dynamically symbolizes their growth in wellness. Each of the five tree branches represent a different tenet of wellness which you can train by completing relevant activities such as meditating or showing kindness to strangers.

Throughout this process, we hope to provide important foundations for some well-studied, central ideas of wellness, and also teach the how and the why, so that users will learn the skills to pursue wellness in their own time, for years to come.
